# Comparative Analysis of ARIMA and LSTM Models in Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project focused on evaluating the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models in forecasting stock prices within industries differently impacted by AI technological advancements. Specifically, the analysis compares these models' predictive accuracy and efficiency in the technology sector, heavily influenced by AI, against the utilities sector, which is less affected by such advancements.

## Objective
The primary goal is to understand how ARIMA and LSTM models handle forecasting tasks in varying industry contexts and to determine their applicability and effectiveness in real-world financial analysis.

## Datasets
The stock price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` API.

## Usage

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fy981006/Price-Prediction-Comparison-between-ARIMA-Model-and-LSTM.git
cd Price-Prediction-Comparison-between-ARIMA-Model-and-LSTM
pip install -r requirements.txt
