# Comparative Analysis of ARIMA and LSTM Models in Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This repository contains a project focused on evaluating the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models in forecasting stock prices within industries differently impacted by AI technological advancements. Specifically, the analysis compares these models' predictive accuracy and efficiency in the technology sector, heavily influenced by AI, against the utilities sector, which is less affected by such advancements.

## Objective
The primary goal is to understand how ARIMA and LSTM models handle forecasting tasks in varying industry contexts and to determine their applicability and effectiveness in real-world financial analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the datasets used in the analysis, including stock prices and R&D expenditure data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the analysis steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and summaries of the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the notebooks.

## Datasets

The stock price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` API.
## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Statsmodels for statistical analysis
- Jupyter for interactive notebooks
